### About me

I am a hybrid individual. Artist, teacher, designer, engineer. I work with media. There may be a specific discipline to name my work in the future. In the meantime, I will explore and share through these stories.

### About these posts

The format of this site, the posts and the software that publishes everything will be updated frequently. It's an experiment.

I encourage dialogue, and if you'd like to comment on something I've written, please reach out to me and tell me what you think. My contact information is below and I am happy to include your comments online with your permission.

This blog uses [Wheat](https://github.com/creationix/wheat), a barebones publishing system for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

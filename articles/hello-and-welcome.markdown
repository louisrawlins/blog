This is a personal blog to contain more than personal reflections. It will include thoughts on health and nutrition, media and advertising, the state of publishing and the arts. Primarily, I am looking at wellness in the most rounded sense of the term: for person, for community and the world. Join me in this journey.

##Create beauty.

For the past few years, I've struggled to establish direction in my life. Physically, emotionally and professionally, I've taken the "normal" path of an artist and bounced from idea to idea as they interest me. I still do. But now I have focus on what I need to accomplish. Right now, that means being a media educator, a designer and an engineer. Spending time studying the arts, studying computers and technology, all while looking for the inter-connections with my life, has not been a straightforward thing. I've learned that with this struggle, I enjoy what I discover. It makes me happy to share this with others because often it helps people to see themselves, and in turn that helps me understand myself and my place in the world. Perhaps, the more we learn to understand and care about ourselves, the easier it will be to care for others.

Quite a few people have inspired and helped me over the years. You will read about them in my posts as I tell stories about the people and things, literature and places, the experiences that have shaped my life.

At thirty-five years old, I am at a unique place in life. I am neither young, nor old. I sit very solidly at the mid-point for age in our society, carrying the recognition that what I have done before has set a foundation for the future. I can see it when I look back, and I am aware that there more to come. It's an exciting place to be.

##Keep experimenting.

You'll find plenty of experiments, on this blog. With media and teaching. With advertising and publishing. Storytelling. Working-styles.

One of the biggest lessons I've learned since completing school is that the more rigidly I define my schedule, the less likely I am to complete what needs to be done with any amount of creativity. I am actively seeking knowledge on the impact of play in my everyday life and in education. I find that it fits anywhere from counseling and business to immersing myself in new situations like a dance in the woods, movement at work, or singing for fun. There is always a way to express and be heard.

##Start a dialogue.

This blog will also serve as a marketing vehicle for my work. I want to be clear about this because communication modes have changed and will continue to change. What direction communications will take and if we, as a globally connected society, will have anything as final and solid as the the printed page (five hundred years in the west is not a bad run) still remains to be seen.

With contemporary marketing, it's not always clear what is simply a fun activity and what is an experience created for monetary return. You will find that I have no definite stance on this subject. As a result, I will point out where, when and how I am advertising to you. Together, I hope we can discover what works and what feels not only appropriate, but desired. Advertising is only one mode of communication, and as such, I feel the expectations should be the same as with any conversation. We listen and speak with those to whom we feel connected. We interact with those whom we have a vested interest.

On this note, I will also be experimenting with that way that I interact with my readers. I encourage direct participation in this blog through email, Twitter, or Facebook — whatever works. Please reach out and contact me. I hope these conversations will serve as comments to my posts that I will add with your permission.

It's a strange world today, and there's not much to bind or define how people behave with one another, so it's good to remember that what you are reading now is produced almost exclusively through electronics. Though I am communicating directly from me to you, this dialogue still exists in a realm separate from the physical. Let's keep that connection to the physical alive. If you're reading from a mobile device, hold your device and feel it in your hand. Take a moment and look up. Look around you. If you're around people, smile at someone. Don't worry — I'll wait. Take your time.

&hellip;

Good. Remember that feeling. Maintain that connection, and let's talk.

Thanks for reading. Enjoy the ride.

__Peace,  Louis__
